  Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) has emerged at the nexus of quantum computing and AI, promising to redefine computational frontiers. This survey critically synthesizes the state-of-the-art through 2024, elucidating the profound bidirectional synergy between these fields. We analyze how classical machine learning is accelerating quantum hardware control, circuit optimization, and error correction. Conversely, we assess the potential quantum advantage of algorithms, including variational and kernel-based methods, across domains such as drug discovery, financial modeling, and cybersecurity. Our analysis reveals a critical trade-off between the utility of near-term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices and the long-term promise of fault-tolerant architectures.
