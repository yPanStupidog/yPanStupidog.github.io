  We introduce Quantum Molecular Autoencoder (MolQAE), the first quantum autoencoder to leverage the complete molecular structures. MolQAE uniquely maps SMILES strings directly to quantum states using parameterized rotation gates, preserving vital structural information. Its quantum encoder–decoder framework enables latent space compression and reconstruction. A dual-objective strategy optimizes fidelity and minimizes trash state deviation. Our evaluations demonstrate effective capture of molecular characteristics and strong fidelity preservation under substantial dimensionality reduction, establishing a quantum pathway in cheminformatics for NISQ-era hardware and promising advances in drug and materials discovery.
