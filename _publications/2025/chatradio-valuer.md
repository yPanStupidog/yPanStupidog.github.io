abstract: >-
    Achieving clinical level performance and widespread deployment for generating radiology impressions encounters a giant challenge for conventional artificial intelligence models tailored to specific diseases and organs. Concurrent with the increasing accessibility of radiology reports and advancements in modern general AI techniques, the emergence and potential of deployable radiology AI exploration have been bolstered. Here, we present ChatRadio-Valuer, the first general radiology diagnosis large language model for localized deployment within hospitals and being close to clinical use for multi-institution and multi-system diseases. ChatRadio-Valuer achieved 15 state-of-the-art results across five human systems and six institutions in clinical-level events (n=332,673) through rigorous and full-spectrum assessment, including engineering metrics, clinical validation, and efficiency evaluation. Notably, it exceeded OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, achieving superior performance in comprehensive disease diagnosis compared to the average level of radiology experts. Besides, ChatRadio-Valuer supports zero-shot transfer learning, greatly boosting its effectiveness as a radiology assistant, while ensuring adherence to privacy standards and being readily utilized for large-scale patient populations. Our expeditions suggest the development of localized LLMs would become an imperative avenue in hospital applications.
