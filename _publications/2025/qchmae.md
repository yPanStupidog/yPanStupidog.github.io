  Although recent advances in quantum machine learning (QML) offer significant potential for enhancing generative models, particularly in molecular design, many classical approaches still struggle to achieve high fidelity and validity. We propose a hybrid quantum–classical architecture for SMILES reconstruction that integrates quantum encoding with classical sequence modeling to improve quantum fidelity and classical similarity. Our approach achieves around 84% quantum fidelity and 60% classical reconstruction similarity, surpassing existing quantum baselines, and provides a promising foundation for quantum‑aware sequence models in molecular and drug discovery.
